i import 2 sam class in ower programe whith using namespace
-file name is first.php
               namespace fast;//create namespace
               {code}//your code

//Operator Precedence
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator.

For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.--Comments--
single line //,#
multiline /*__*/

--variable starts with the $ sign

--Rules for PHP variables:
A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)

--PHP has three different variable scopes:
{1}local-outside funtion
{2}global-inside funtion
{3}static-value are not changed

--PHP data types:
String
Integer
Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
Boolean
Array
Object
NULL
Resource

--PHP Object
Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.

A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

--PHP String Functions 
strlen() - Return the Length of a String
str_word_count() - Count Words in a String
strrev() - Reverse a String
strpos() - Search For a Text Within a String
str_replace() - Replace Text Within a String

--Check if the type of a variable 
var_dump(is_int($x));
var_dump(is_float($x));
var_dump($x);//Check if a numeric value is finite or infinite
var_dump($x);//Invalid calculation will return a NaN value
var_dump(is_numeric($x));Check if the variable is numeric
$int_cast = (int)$x;Cast float and string to integer

--PHP Math
pi()//pai value
min()
max()
abs()//used to return the absolute(positive) value of a number
sqrt()//returns square root of a positive float number
round()//used to round a floating-point number
rand()//rendem namber

--PHP Constants
define(name, value, case-insensitive)// ther are 3 paramiter when case-insensitive bydefolt true,The value cannot be changed during the script,In PHP7, you can create an Array constant using the define() function.
Note:-If you create a __construct() function, PHP will automatically call this function when you create an object from a class.

--PHP Operators
Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Increment/Decrement operators
Logical operators
String operators
Array operators
Conditional assignment operators-+,-,/,*,**,%

--PHP Conditional Statements
if else
swich case

--PHP Loops
while (entry control)
do while(exit control)
for loop(entry control)
foreach
break/continue

--PHP Functions
PHP Function with Arguments
PHP Default Argument Value
PHP Functions - Returning values

Passing Arguments by Reference

--PHP Arrays
In PHP, there are three types of arrays:
1.Indexed arrays - Arrays with a numeric index
2.Associative arrays - Arrays with named keys
3.Multidimensional arrays - Arrays containing one or more arrays

--PHP Sorting Arrays
sort() - sort arrays in ascending order
rsort() - sort arrays in descending order
asort() - sort associative arrays in ascending order, according to the value
ksort() - sort associative arrays in ascending order, according to the key
arsort() - sort associative arrays in descending order, according to the value
krsort() - sort associative arrays in descending order, according to the key

--PHP Global Variables - Superglobals
$GLOBALS//used to access global variables
$_SERVER//which holds information about headers, paths, and script locations,all information abute your system & natwerk
$_REQUEST//used to collect data after submitting an HTML form
$_POST
$_GET
$_FILES
$_ENV
$_COOKIE
$_SESSION

--PHP Regular Expressions
preg_match()	Returns 1 if the pattern was found in the string and 0 if not

preg_match_all()	Returns the number of times the pattern was found in the string, which may also be 0

preg_replace()	Returns a new string where matched patterns have been replaced with another string

--Regular Expression Modifiers
i	Performs a case-insensitive search
m	Performs a multiline search (patterns that search for the beginning or end of a string will match the beginning or end of each line)

u	Enables correct matching of UTF-8 encoded patterns

--Regular Expression Patterns
[abc]	Find one character from the options between the brackets
[^abc]	Find any character NOT between the brackets
[0-9]	Find one character from the range 0 to 9

--Metacharacters
Metacharacter	Description
|	Find a match for any one of the patterns separated by | as in: cat|dog|fish
.	Find just one instance of any character
^	Finds a match as the beginning of a string as in: ^Hello
$	Finds a match at the end of the string as in: World$
\d	Find a digit
\s	Find a whitespace character
\b	Find a match at the beginning of a word like this: \bWORD, or at the end of a word like this: WORD\b
\uxxxx	Find the Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal number xxxx
--Quantifier	
n+	Matches any string that contains at least one n
n*	Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
n?	Matches any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n
n{x}	Matches any string that contains a sequence of X n's
n{x,y}	Matches any string that contains a sequence of X to Y n's
n{x,}	Matches any string that contains a sequence of at least X n's

--Grouping
You can use parentheses ( ) to apply quantifiers to entire patterns. They also can be used to select parts of the pattern to be used as a match.

--php form handling
GET vs. POST

$_GET is an array of variables passed to the current script via the URL parameters.
$_POST is an array of variables passed to the current script via the HTTP POST method.
When to use GET?
Note: GET should NEVER be used for sending passwords or other sensitive information!

--form validation
Name	Required. + Must only contain letters and whitespace
E-mail	Required. + Must contain a valid email address (with @ and .)
Website	Optional. If present, it must contain a valid URL
Comment	Optional. Multi-line input field (textarea)
Gender	Required. Must select one

--What is the $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] variable?
The $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] is a super global variable that returns the filename of the currently executing script.

--What is the htmlspecialchars() function?
The htmlspecialchars() function converts special characters to HTML entities. This means that it will replace HTML characters like < and > with &lt; and &gt;. This prevents attackers from exploiting the code by injecting HTML or Javascript code (Cross-site Scripting attacks) in forms.

--$isset()
The isset() function checks whether a variable is set, which means that it has to be declared and is not NULL.

--Get a Date
The required format parameter of the date() function specifies how to format the date (or time).

Here are some characters that are commonly used for dates:

d - Represents the day of the month (01 to 31)
m - Represents a month (01 to 12)
Y - Represents a year (in four digits)
l (lowercase 'L') - Represents the day of the week
Other characters, like"/", ".", or "-" can also be inserted between the characters to add additional formatting.

--Get a Time
Here are some characters that are commonly used for times:

H - 24-hour format of an hour (00 to 23)
h - 12-hour format of an hour with leading zeros (01 to 12)
i - Minutes with leading zeros (00 to 59)
s - Seconds with leading zeros (00 to 59)
a - Lowercase Ante meridiem and Post meridiem (am or pm)

--file hadaling
1.readfile() function reads a file and writes it to the output buffer.
2.fwrite()
3.fclose()
4.Upload File

--What is a Cookie?
A cookie is often used to identify a user. A cookie is a small file that the server embeds on the user's computer. Each time the same computer requests a page with a browser, it will send the cookie too. With PHP, you can both create and retrieve cookie values.

-- PHP Session
A session is started with the session_start() function.
Session variables are set with the PHP global variable: $_SESSION.

--PHP Filters Advanced
Validate IPv6 Address
Validate an Integer Within a Range
Validate URL
etc.

--Callback Functions
A callback function (often referred to as just "callback") is a function which is passed as an argument into another function.
--arry_map() to pass arry  data stap by stap

Any existing function can be used as a callback function. To use a function as a callback function, pass a string containing the name of the function as the argument of another function:

--What is JSON?
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.
Since the JSON format is a text-based format, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.
json_encode()
json_decode()

--What is an Exception?
An exception is an object that describes an error or unexpected behaviour of a PHP script.

Exceptions are thrown by many PHP functions and classes.

User defined functions and classes can also throw exceptions.

Exceptions are a good way to stop a function when it comes across data that it cannot use.
Throwing an Exception
The throw statement allows a user defined function or method to throw an exception. When an exception is thrown, the code following it will not be executed.

If an exception is not caught, a fatal error will occur with an "Uncaught Exception" message.
-try cach() statment
-throw statment
