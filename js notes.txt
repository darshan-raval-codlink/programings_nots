//4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
Using var
Using let
Using const
Using nothing


//The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).

Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.

Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.

Variables defined with let have Block Scope.

//Block Scope
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.

ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.

Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

//concatenate

The + operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings.
The += assignment operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings:

//exponentiation
The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.

//JavaScript has 3 types of scope:

Block scope
Function scope
Local Scope
Global scope

//JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted
In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.
In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.

//strict mode
It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.

The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".

With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.

//JavaScript JSON
JSON is a format for storing and transporting data.
JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a lightweight data interchange format
JSON is language independent *
JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

//constructor
It is considered good practice to name constructor functions with an upper-case first letter.

//JavaScript Closures
elacical scope
JavaScript variables can belong to the local or global scope.

Global variables can be made local (private) with closures.

Remember self-invoking functions? What does this function do?
